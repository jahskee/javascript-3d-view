## Specification

* OBJ loader for loading a geometry format that is as old and widely supported as GIFs.
* MTL loader for loading really simple materials.
* Orbit controls to smoothly turn the camera around the model.
* Nearest-neighbor filtering and a pure white ambient light to showcase pixel art textures.
* All libraries taken from the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) repository.
